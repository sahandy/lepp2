 * A LOLA-specific implementation of an `ObstacleAggregator`.
 *
 * It serializes the received obstacles into a format where each obstacle is
 * represented by 11 integers. Each integer is serialized with machine-specific
 * endianess; no care is taken to perform integer serialization for network
 * transfer, i.e. big-endian. In general, this is not the safest assumption to
 * make, but the LOLA controller has been working under this assumption for now,
 * so enforcing a big-endian encoding would just introduce additional complexity.
 *
 * The serialized representation of each obstacle is packed into a single
 * datagram and sent over UDP to the remote host described by the initial
 * constructor parameters.
